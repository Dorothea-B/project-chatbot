# Chatbot

I had a really hard time with this assignment. I don't know if it's because I worked on it without a code buddy or if I've somehow missed some lesson materials, but I really had no idea where to start. I've looked over all the reading materials and watched the videos several times but in the end I decided to copy the source code from technigo's chatbot example to try and reverse-engineer my solution.  

This didn't help much as I still felt very overwhelmed by the javascript and haven't really managed to understand it. I would ask on stack overflow if I could articulate or pinpoint one sepcific issue, but at this point it's too confusing and I don't really know where to start.

I think  one of the problems are that I have three different eventlisteners. 1 - the form submit, 2 - the senbtn click and 3 - the input keypress, but when I try to remove any of them the bot stops working. 

Another issue is that I can't seem to type directly within the form, I can however copy/paste into it. 
I also get double "showTattooStyles"-responses from the bot. It also previously skipped over a question but this I managed to fix by assigning the questions specific numbers instead of using the "++". 

I really feel like there has been a dramatic leap in how advanced the assignment is and hopefully I'll find the resources to catch up soon.
